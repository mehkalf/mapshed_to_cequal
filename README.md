# mapshed_to_cequal
# matlab script for transforming mapshed (hydrologic model) output to cequal (hydrodynamic water quality model) input format
# reads daily flow, total nitrogen and total phosphorus data from mapshed output file
# separates the total nitrogen data into ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen fractions according to the measurement results.
# separates the total phosphorus data into phosphate and organic phosphorus fractions according to the measurement results.
# saving flow files (Q_FILES) and water quality concentration files (C_FILES) seperately.
